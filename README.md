4.5 Stone Inventory Management

Scenario: You are managing a stone inventory stored in a dictionary where key = item name, value = (price, quantity). Write a program to display items that are out of stock and total value of available stock.

Algorithm:

1. Create the inventory dictionary with item names as keys and tuples (price, quantity) as values.

2. Initialize total_value to 0.

3. Loop over each item in inventory: extract price and quantity.

4. If quantity == 0, print it as out of stock.

5. Else, add (price * quantity) to total_value.

6. After loop, print the total value of available stock.

Output:

Out of stock items:

Bananas

Grapes

Total value of available stock: $2170
